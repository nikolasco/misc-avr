This directory contains all the source files for my "single board LED heart".

It includes the electrical and PCB designs:
  hardware/
    heart.brd       physical PCB design (CadSoft EAGLE)
    heart.sch       electrical schematic (CadSoft EAGLE)

Documentation (parts, assembling, usage):
  docs/
    build-dl.sh     build HTML and PDF manuals, resize photos
    conf.py         Sphinx config file
    index.rst       central file, listing files for subsections
    licensing.rst   information about the license of the manual and sources
    parts.rst       list of parts
    photos/         what it says on the tin
    using.rst       directions for operating the heart

General C header files:
  firmware/
    dimming.h       code for dimming LEDs, not specific to this project
    general-avr.h   AVR utilities, not specific to this project
    heart.h         mapping hardware to symbolic names and functions

A variety of programs:
  firmware/
    animate-basic.c simple on/off animations
    animate-fade.c  animations with fading transitions
    pulse-all.c     fade all of the LEDs on and then face them off, repeat indefinitely
    shine-all.c     simply turn on all of the LEDs

Some auxiallry scripts:
  firmware/
    Makefile        build and install the firmware (simply run 'make')
  firmware/scripts/
    gen-table.rb    generate lookup table mapping lightness to luminance
    sched.rb        generate the bit schedule for dimmed LEDs
