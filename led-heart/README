This directory contains all the source files for my "single board LED heart".

It includes the electrical and PCB designs:
  heart.brd       physical PCB design (CadSoft EAGLE)
  heart.sch       electrical schematic (CadSoft EAGLE)

General C header files:
  dimming.h       code for dimming LEDs, not specific to this project
  general-avr.h   AVR utilities, not specific to this project
  heart.h         mapping hardware to symbolic names and functions

A variety of programs:
  animate-basic.c simple on/off animations
  animate-fade.c  animations with fading transitions
  pulse-all.c     fade all of the LEDs on and then face them off, repeat indefinitely
  shine-all.c     simply turn on all of the LEDs

Some auxiallry scripts:
  gen-table.rb    generate lookup table mapping lightness to luminance
  Makefile        build and install the firmware (simply run 'make')
  sched.rb        generate the bit schedule for dimmed LEDs
