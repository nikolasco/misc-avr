This directory contains all the source files for my "single board LED heart".

It includes the electrical and PCB designs:
  hardware/
    heart.brd       physical PCB design (CadSoft EAGLE)
    heart.sch       electrical schematic (CadSoft EAGLE)

General C header files:
  firmware/
    dimming.h       code for dimming LEDs, not specific to this project
    general-avr.h   AVR utilities, not specific to this project
    heart.h         mapping hardware to symbolic names and functions

A variety of programs:
  firmware/
    animate-basic.c simple on/off animations
    animate-fade.c  animations with fading transitions
    pulse-all.c     fade all of the LEDs on and then face them off, repeat indefinitely
    shine-all.c     simply turn on all of the LEDs

Some auxiallry scripts:
  firmware/
    Makefile        build and install the firmware (simply run 'make')
  firmware/scripts/
    gen-table.rb    generate lookup table mapping lightness to luminance
    sched.rb        generate the bit schedule for dimmed LEDs
